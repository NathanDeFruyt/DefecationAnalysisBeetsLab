# Defecation Analysis Beets Lab

This script analyses defecation data. This script was written
in R version 4.0.4 "Lost Library Book" with warmth and love for the dearest 
of my colleagues Signe Kenis (signe.kenis@kuleuven.be). 

More info on the format your data should be in, can be requested with 
Signe, with Prof. Dr. Isabel Beets (isabel.beets@kuleuven.be), or at my adress
(nathan.defruyt@kuleuven.be). Behavioural data was collected in BORIS
(https://www.boris.unito.it/).

Please refer to the above contacts for any suggestions or questions you would have.

The script provides an easy to use interface for colleagues that do not code
to quickly extract two features of defecation data: 
- cycle length
- expulsion frequency
